To create a temporary user named `ammar` on **App Server 3** in the **Stratos Datacenter** with an expiry date of **2024-01-28**, follow these steps:

### üõ†Ô∏è Steps to Create the User

1. **Access App Server 3**  
   Use SSH to connect:
   ```bash
   ssh username@appserver3.stratos.example.com
   ```
   *(Replace `username` and domain as per your environment.)*

2. **Create the User with Expiry Date**  
   Run the following command:
   ```bash
   sudo useradd -e 2024-01-28 ammar
   ```
   - `-e` sets the expiry date.
   - `ammar` is lowercase, as required.

3. **Set a Password (Optional but Recommended)**  
   ```bash
   sudo passwd ammar
   ```

4. **Verify the User and Expiry**  
   Confirm the account was created with the correct expiry:
   ```bash
   sudo chage -l ammar
   ```

   You should see:
   ```
   Account expires : Jan 28, 2024
   ```

Let me know if you need to automate this with a script or apply similar settings to other servers.
