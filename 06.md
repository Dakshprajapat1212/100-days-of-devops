Got it! Here's a ready-to-copy set of commands and steps to disable direct root SSH login on all three **application servers** in the Stratos Datacenter: `stapp01`, `stapp02`, and `stapp03`.

## üõ°Ô∏è Disable Root SSH Login on All App Servers

### üîß Step-by-Step Instructions

For each server, follow these steps after logging in via the **jump_host**:

---

### ‚úÖ Server: `stapp01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com`
```bash
ssh thor@jump_host.stratos.xfusioncorp.com
ssh tony@stapp01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com
# Enter password: Ir0nM@n

sudo sed -i 's/^PermitRootLogin.*/PermitRootLogin no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
sudo systemctl restart sshd
exit
```

---

### ‚úÖ Server: `stapp02.stratos.xfusioncorp.com`
```bash
ssh thor@jump_host.stratos.xfusioncorp.com
ssh steve@stapp02.stratos.xfusioncorp.com
# Enter password: Am3ric@

sudo sed -i 's/^PermitRootLogin.*/PermitRootLogin no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
sudo systemctl restart sshd
exit
```

---

### ‚úÖ Server: `stapp03.stratos.xfusioncorp.com`
```bash
ssh thor@jump_host.stratos.xfusioncorp.com
ssh banner@stapp03.stratos.xfusioncorp.com
# Enter password: BigGr33n

sudo sed -i 's/^PermitRootLogin.*/PermitRootLogin no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
sudo systemctl restart sshd
exit
```

---

### üß™ Optional: Verify the Change
After applying the changes, you can test by trying to SSH as root:
```bash
ssh root@stapp01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com
# Should be denied
```

Absolutely! You're working on a task from KodeKloud's Engineer program that involves **disabling direct root SSH login** on all application servers in the **Stratos Datacenter**. Here's a breakdown of what that means and why it's important:

---

## üîê What Is "Direct Root SSH Login"?

- **SSH (Secure Shell)** is a protocol used to securely access remote servers.
- **Root** is the most powerful user on a Linux system, with unrestricted access.
- **Direct root login via SSH** means someone can log in as root without first authenticating as a regular user.

---

## üö´ Why Disable It?

- **Security Risk**: If attackers gain root access directly, they can control the entire system.
- **Best Practice**: Most organizations require users to log in as a regular user and then use `sudo` to perform admin tasks.
- **Audit Compliance**: Disabling root login helps meet security audit requirements and reduces attack surface.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è What You Did (or Need to Do)

On each app server (`stapp01`, `stapp02`, `stapp03`), you:

1. Logged in via the **jump host** (a secure gateway).
2. Edited the SSH configuration file:
   ```bash
   sudo sed -i 's/^PermitRootLogin.*/PermitRootLogin no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   ```
   - This command finds the line that starts with `PermitRootLogin` and changes it to `PermitRootLogin no`.
3. Restarted the SSH service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart sshd
   ```
   - This applies the new settings immediately.

---

## ‚úÖ Result

After these steps:
- No one can log in directly as root via SSH.
- Users must log in with their own accounts (e.g., `tony`, `steve`, `banner`) and use `sudo` for admin tasks.

Let me know if you want a script to automate this across all servers or need help verifying the changes.
