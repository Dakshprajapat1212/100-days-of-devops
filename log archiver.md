Nice — you’re on the right track. Short answer: yes, the high-level approach you described is fine for an interview (target folder → compress → store in archive folder → schedule with cron → timestamp filenames). But you can improve how you say it, and it helps a lot to have a tiny, correct script ready to show. Below I’ll give:
	1.	A short, interview-ready spiel you can say when you forget exact syntax.
	2.	A clear, safe example Bash script (copy-paste ready).
	3.	A cron line and a few quick talking points (best practices + whether it’s OK to use AI on the spot).

1) Short interview spiel (say this confidently)

“​I’d write a small Bash script that compresses the application log directory into a timestamped archive (tar.gz) and moves it into a dedicated archive folder. I’d use a lock (flock) so only one instance runs at a time, keep a retention policy to delete old archives, and schedule it with cron (or a systemd timer). For production I’d prefer logrotate or journald because they handle rotation gracefully, but for a simple archiver this script is safe and idempotent. If you want, I can write the exact script now.”

2) Example script (bash) — safe, commented, ready to use

#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

# CONFIG
SRC_DIR="/var/log/myapp"                      # directory containing logs to archive
DEST_DIR="/home/$(whoami)/log-archives"       # where archives will be stored
RETENTION_DAYS=7                              # remove archives older than this
LOCKFILE="/var/lock/log-archiver.lock"        # lock to avoid concurrent runs

# prepare
mkdir -p "$DEST_DIR"
TIMESTAMP=$(date '+%Y%m%d-%H%M%S')
ARCHIVE_NAME="myapp-logs-$TIMESTAMP.tar.gz"
ARCHIVE_PATH="$DEST_DIR/$ARCHIVE_NAME"

# Acquire a lock (exit if another instance running)
exec 200>"$LOCKFILE"
flock -n 200 || { echo "Another log-archiver instance is running — exiting."; exit 1; }

# Create archive (compress whole folder contents)
# -C changes to SRC_DIR so archive contains relative paths (no leading /)
tar -czf "$ARCHIVE_PATH" -C "$SRC_DIR" .

# OPTIONAL: truncate the original .log files (keeps same inode - safe for most apps)
# Use with caution; prefer logrotate in production.
for f in "$SRC_DIR"/*.log; do
  [ -f "$f" ] || continue
  : > "$f"    # truncate to zero bytes
done

# Remove old archives
find "$DEST_DIR" -type f -name 'myapp-logs-*.tar.gz' -mtime +"$RETENTION_DAYS" -print -delete

echo "Archived $SRC_DIR -> $ARCHIVE_PATH"

Notes on the script:
	•	set -euo pipefail makes errors fatal and safer.
	•	flock prevents overlapping runs (important if cron could start another while previous is running).
	•	I used truncation (: > file) after archiving — this is usually safe (keeps same file handle) but in production prefer logrotate because it handles signals and app-specific behavior.
	•	The find ... -mtime line enforces retention.

3) Crontab example

Run daily at 00:05:

5 0 * * * /usr/local/bin/log-archiver.sh >> /var/log/log-archiver.log 2>&1

(Or place the script in /usr/local/bin and make executable chmod +x /usr/local/bin/log-archiver.sh.)

4) What to say about using AI (GPT-5) in interviews
	•	It’s fine to say “I’d prototype a small script with an AI snippet or check man pages,” but add that you’ll review and understand every line before using it.
	•	In interviews, emphasize that you understand the steps and trade-offs — don’t lean on “I’ll just ask AI” as the main answer. Use AI as a productivity aid, not a crutch.

5) Extra quick best-practice bullets (good to mention)
	•	Prefer logrotate for production systems (it’s the standard for rotating and truncating logs safely).
	•	Make the script idempotent and use locks.
	•	Ensure correct file permissions and that the archive destination has enough space.
	•	Consider shipping logs to central storage (S3, ELK) for long-term retention/analysis.
	•	Add monitoring/alerts if archiving or disk space fails.

⸻

Want me to:
	•	make a single-file version tuned to /var/log/myapp and give the exact chmod/install commands, or
	•	write a logrotate config instead, or
	•	make a version that uploads archives to S3?

Pick one and I’ll drop it in — ready to paste into an interview.
