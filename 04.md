Following security audits, the xFusionCorp Industries security team has rolled out new protocols, including the restriction of direct root SSH login.



Your task is to disable direct SSH root login on all app servers within the Stratos Datacenter.


To create a temporary user named `ammar` on **App Server 1 (stapp01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com)** with an expiry date of **2024-01-28**, follow these steps:

### 🛠️ Steps to Create the User

1. **Access the Jump Server**  
   First, SSH into the jump server using the provided credentials:
   ```bash
   ssh thor@jump_host.stratos.xfusioncorp.com
   ```
   Password: `mjolnir123`

2. **SSH into App Server 1**  
   From the jump server, connect to App Server 1:
   ```bash
   ssh tony@stapp01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com
   ```
   Password: `Ir0nM@n`

3. **Create the User with Expiry Date**  
   Run the following command to create the user `ammar` with the specified expiry:
   ```bash
   sudo useradd -e 2024-01-28 ammar
   ```

4. **Set a Password for the User (Optional but Recommended)**  
   You can set a password for the user like this:
   ```bash
   sudo passwd ammar
   ```

5. **Verify the User and Expiry**  
   Confirm the user was created and expiry is set:
   ```bash
   sudo chage -l ammar


   Great question! The `-e` option in the `useradd` command stands for **expiry date**. It’s used to specify the **date when the user account will be automatically disabled**.

### 🧾 What `-e` Does
When you run:
```bash
sudo useradd -e 2024-01-28 ammar
```
You're telling the system:
> “Create a user named `ammar`, and make sure their account expires on January 28, 2024.”

After this date:
- The user won’t be able to log in.
- The account still exists, but it’s **locked**.
- You can re-enable it manually if needed.

### 🔍 How to Check Expiry
To verify the expiry date after creation:
```bash
sudo chage -l ammar
```
This will show:
- Account expiry date
- Password expiry info
- Last password change

Let me know if you want to set a password expiry too or automate this for multiple users.
   ```


To check if the user `ammar` exists in the system using the `/etc/passwd` file, you should use the `grep` command like this:

```bash
grep ammar /etc/passwd
```

This command searches for the string `ammar` in the `/etc/passwd` file, which contains user account information. If the user exists, you’ll see a line like:

```
ammar:x:1001:1001::/home/ammar:/bin/bash
```

### 🔍 What the Fields Mean
- `ammar`: Username
- `x`: Password placeholder (actual password stored in `/etc/shadow`)

- 
- `1001`: User ID (UID)
- `1001`: Group ID (GID)
- `::`: User description (empty here)
- `/home/ammar`: Home directory
- `/bin/bash`: Default shell
