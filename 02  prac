To accommodate the backup agent tool's specifications, the system admin team at xFusionCorp Industries requires the creation of a user with a non-interactive shell. Here's your task:



Create a user named anita with a non-interactive shell on App Server 2.





Exactly — you're spot on 🔐

In real-world usage:

- **`hostname.com`** is just a placeholder — like saying "example.com" or "yourserver.com" in tutorials.
- You replace it with the **actual domain name or IP address** of the server you're connecting to.
- And yes, you use your **real private key** to authenticate securely.

## 🧪 Real vs. Example

| Tutorial Example                  | Real-World Equivalent                          |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `ssh user@hostname.com`          | `ssh devops@192.168.1.10` or `ssh admin@prod.mycompany.com` |
| `~/.ssh/id_rsa`                  | Your actual private key file (securely stored) |
| `hostname.com`                   | Real server IP or DNS name                    |

## 🔐 Real SSH Login Example

Let’s say you have a server at `staging.mycompany.com` and your private key is `~/.ssh/id_rsa_devops`. You’d log in like this:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_devops devops@staging.mycompany.com
```

No passwords. Just cryptographic trust between your private key and the server’s authorized public key.

So yes — in real life, you use:
- A **real hostname or IP**
- A **real private key**
- And the server must have your **public key** installed
